Then save this pipeline into the property store. This causes the system to automatically register this pipeline and execute it whenever an event with given key and matching filter is fired. Note: Only one event.listen command per pipeline is allowed and it needs to be the very first command in the pipeline. In the body of the pipeline the event object is provided and can be used for filtering for example.

To do so, a magic link (verification link) is sent \n to his email account. Only if the user clicks on this link within \n a certain amount of time (default is 10min), the subsequent pipe \n commands are executed. From a technical point of view this is done \n by putting the current state of the message into a cache which deletes \n any entries older than 10min. Then, the email with the key to this \n cache entry (=challenge) is send to the user. If the user clicks on \n this link, the message is loaded from the cache using the challenge as \n the key. If the user clicked within 10min, the entry is here, can be \n loaded and the message execution can be resumed. Otherwise if the user \n clicks after 10min on the link, no more entry in it. Execution fails. \n User has to re-request the link.
