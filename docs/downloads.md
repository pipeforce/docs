## Command Line Interface (CLI)

The CLI can be used to simplify working with PIPEFORCE.

You can download the latest version [here](https://github.com/logabit/pipeforce-cli/releases/latest).

Follow the download and installation instructions [here](https://github.com/logabit/pipeforce-cli).

## BPMN Modeler

The BPMN modeler is a free tool to design BPMN diagrams and save the BPMN files offline. These files then can be deployed to PIPEFORCE using the `workflow.deploy` command or using the online workbench.

:::tip 
The PIPEFORCE portal has also an online BPMN designer built-in, so an offline tool like this is optional in this case.
