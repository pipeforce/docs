This is the reference documentation of the built-in events which comes out-of-the-box with PIPEFORCE. 

Here is an example on how to listen for such events in a **persisted** pipeline:

```yaml
pipeline:
 - event.listen:
     key: "iam.login.error"
 - log:
     message: "A login has been failed!"
```

Every time an event is fired matching the given criteria, all commands after ``event.listen`` will be executed.

Also see the **[Event Guide](../guides/events)** for details about the structure and usage of events.

## property.created

It is fired every time a new property gets created in the property store. 

It contains as ``origin``, the value ``null``, and as ``target``, the property created before. 

```json
{
  "payload": {
    "origin": null,
    "target": {
      "uuid": "string",
      "key": "string",
      "type": "string",
      "value": "string",
      "created": timestamp,
      "updated": timestamp
    }
  }
}
```

## property.copied

It is fired every time a property gets copied in the property store.

It contains as ``origin``, the source property, and as ``target``, the property where source was copied to.

      "key": "string",
      "type": "string",
      "value": "string",
      "created": timestamp,
