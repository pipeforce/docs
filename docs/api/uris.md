Reference documentation of built-int custom URI types.

Whenever you need to load data from a location, you can use a [URI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier) to  point to such a location. You do so already by using such URIs in your web browser, for example. Common URI types you might be familiar with, are:

- ``https://www.google.com``
- ``ftp://smith:12345@ftp.host``
- ``file:/data/path/contract.docx``

Besides such commonly known URI types, PIPEFORE also supports custom URI types to simplify access to common resources. Whenever a URI is accepted as an argument, for example in commands or utils, you can apply such custom URIs. Here are some examples of such custom URIs in PIPEFORCE:

:::info Examples 
- ``$uri:drive:/someFolder/myFile.txt`` - Loads a file from the ``drive`` data room.
- ``$uri:property:global/app/myapp/template/text`` - Loads a property from the property store.
- ``$uri:property:global/app/myapp/template/text@value`` - Loads the value of a property from the property store.
- ``$uri:pipeline:global/app/myapp/pipeline/hello`` - Executes the persisted pipeline at given location and returns the final body content as result.
- ``$uri:user:admin`` - Returns the information object of the given user with given username.
- ``$uri:user:uuid=260e8400-e29b-11d4-a716-443655440000`` - Returns the information object of the given user with given uuid.
:::

:::tip Note
Custom PIPEFORCE uris typically start with prefix ``$uri:`` followed by the concrete uri type. 
:::

Here is an example to apply a custom URI on a command:

```yaml
pipeline:
    - mails.send:
        to: recipient@mail.tld
        subject: "Hello!"
        message": Hello World!"
        attachments: "$uri:property:global/app/myapp/resources/file"
```
As you can see in this example, the attachments argument contains a custom URI pointing to a property in the property store. This property will be loaded and added as an attachment.

And in this example, a custom uri is used inside a PEL util instead:

```yaml
pipeline:
    - set.body:
        value: "#{@uri.resolve('$uri:drive:/someFolder/document.json')}"
```

## Drive URI

This custom URI points to a file on the data room service ``drive``.

```
$uri:drive:[PATH TO FILE OR FOLDER]
```
Example:

```yaml
pipeline:
    - mail.send:
        attachments: "$uri:drive:/contracts/contract1.pdf"
```

## Pipeline URI

This URI can be used to execute a persisted pipeline, and return the final body output of this pipeline as a result.

```
$uri:pipeline:[PIPELINE PATH]
```

Let's assume you have a pipeline like this stored at ``global/app/myapp/pipeline/hello``:

```yaml
pipeline:
    - set.body:
        value: "HELLO WORLD!"
```

To execute this pipeline and to output this hello world example, you could execute a URI like this:

```yaml
pipeline:
    - log:
        message: "Output: #{@uri.resolve('$uri:pipeline:global/app/myapp/pipeline/hello')}"
```

This will create a log-entry like this:

```
Output: HELLO WORLD!
```

## Property URI

This custom URI points to a property in the property store.

```
$uri:property:[KEY PATH OF THE PROPERTY]
```

Example:

```yaml
pipeline:
    - set.body:
        value: "#{@uri.resolve('$uri:property:global/app/myapp/object/person')}"
```

### Property Filter

It is also possible to further filter the property using a PE, which gets applied to the property before its result will be returned.

```
$uri:property:[PATH]@[PROPERTY_PEL]
```

As you might already know, a property has a structure like this:

```json
{

    "key": "/unique/path/of/the/property",
    "uuid": "unique id",
    "type": "mime type of this property",
    "created": createdTimeStampInMillis,
    "value": "The payload of the property",
    "attachments": [

        {
            "uuid": "unique id",
            "name": "file name of the attachment",
            "size": bytes,
            "contentType": "content type of this attachment",
            "chunks": [
                {
                    "size": bytes,
                    "content": byteArray
                },
                ...
            ]
        },
        ...
    ]
    ...
}
```

For a full list of the attributes of a property, please refer to the [Property Store Guide](../propertystore#what-is-a-property).

With a Property Filter, you can now select the part you would like to return in your URI:

```yaml
pipeline:
    - log:
        message: "Num. of attachments: #{@uri.resolve('$uri:property:global/app/myapp/object/person@attachments.size()')}"
```
As you can see in this example, you can count the number of attachments of the property with a single URI call.

### Value Filter

In case the value of a property is of the type ``application/json``, you can apply a value filter in order to return just a subset from the JSON value.

```
$uri:property:[PATH]#[VALUE_PEL]
```
:::caution
This filter only works in case the value of the property is of the type: ``application/json``!
:::

Let's assume we have a property in the property store like this:

```json
{
    "key": "path/to/person",
    "type": "application/json",
    "value": {
        "name": "Max Master",
        "age": 35,
        "hobbies": [
            "swimming",
            "hiking"
        ]
    }
}
```

We can use a Value Filter in the URI in order to directly return the name of the person, like this:

```yaml
pipeline:
    - log:
        message: "Name: #{@uri.resolve('$uri:property:path/to/person#name')}"
```

Which will log a message like this:

```
Name: Max Master
```

It's possible to use the full power of the PEL to filter, for example:

```yaml
pipeline:
    - log:
        message: "Number of hobbies: #{@uri.resolve('$uri:property:path/to/person#hobbies.size()')}"
```

Which will log a message like this:

```
Number of hobbies: 3
```

## User URI

This uri is handy to load a user object given by a username or uuid.

```
$uri:user:[USERNAME]
```

or

```
$uri:user:uuid=[UUID]
```

For example:

```yaml
pipeline:
    - set.body:
        value: "#{@uri.resolve('$uri:user:maria')}"
```

This will return the user-info data similar to this:

```json
{
    "uuid": "someUuid",
    "username": "maria",
    "email": "some@email.tld",
    "firstName": "Maria",
    "lastName": "Meyer",
    ...
}
```

The same is true when using the uuid of the user:

```yaml
pipeline:
    - set.body:
        value: "#{@uri.resolve('$uri:user:uuid=someUuid')}"
```
