Since PIPEFORCE is an open environment, there are a lot of possibilities to log, trace, monitor and and analyze messages from different services. So there is no question, that this is possible inside Kubernetes, for example. But sometimes, setting this up and maintaining it could be a lot of effort, depending on your concrete requirements. Therefore, PIPEFORCE tries to make this as smooth as possible for you by providing a set of standard toolings for monitoring, most of them ready to be used out-of-the-box.
