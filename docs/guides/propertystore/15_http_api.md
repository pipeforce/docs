In order to access and manage the property store using HTTP requests, you can use the [`property.*`](/docs/api/commands#propertyappconfig-v1) commands.

See here for a reference of all such commands: [Commands Reference](/docs/api/commands#propertyappconfig-v1).

Furthermore, take a look how to execute these commands using HTTP: [Commands and Pipeline HTTP API](/docs/guides/commands_pipelines/http_api).
