# Trash Bin

## What is a Trash Bin?

Before really deleting a property, it can be moved to a trash bin, similar as it is for file in most operating systems.

In case property has been moved to the trash bin, it will be hidden from most listings.

Furthermore a property moved to trash bin can no longer be edited since a lock of type `trash` has been set on it. For internals of how the locking works, see [Property Locks](/docs/guides/propertystore/property_locks).

After a certain amount of time (the time-to-live = ttl) the property will be fully deleted from the system.
