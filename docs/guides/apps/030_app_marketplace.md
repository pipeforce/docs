Any PIPEFORCE app can be shared with others on a public marketplace. Admins of other PIPEFORCE instances can easily install your app by searching for it and installing it with one click:

## Publishing 

Publishing an app is an easy process:

  1. Make sure, your app is pushed to a public GitHub repository and the resources of your app are stored inside the `src` folder. See this [app repo](https://github.com/logabit/pipeforce-app-examples) as an example,
  2. Add the GitHub topics `pipeforce-marketplace` and `pipeforce-app` to your repository. Optionally also add a description to your repo which is displayed in the marketplace later.
   
Done. Now anyone can search and find your app in the marketplace section of the PIPEFORCE portal and install it with one click.
