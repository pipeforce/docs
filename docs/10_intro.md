# Getting Started

**Integrate your Systems + Automate your Business.**

PIPEFORCE is an enterprise-grade business process automation and application integration platform. It is available as a hosted version (iPaaS) or can be run On-Premises. It is built entirely cloud-native and runs inside Kubernetes using microservices and messaging. Designed ground-up that way. 

It covers all aspects to create best-of-breed enterprise solutions for your new age enterprise. It helps to develop, deploy and operate digital services, workflow apps, and data mappings across the entire journey from planning and discussion to implementation and testing with full life-cycle management. Everything on a single turnkey platform which offers low-code and custom microservice development:

## What is PIPEFORCE for?

PIPEFORCE helps you to:

- integrate applications
- automate processes
- build and orchestrate microservices
- automate testing of complex solutions
- monitor and report processes and messages
- document workflows
- train processes with users

All of this on a single platform running on Kubernetes.

We at PIPEFORCE believe that the digital success of new age enterprises lies in the ability to scale the development of digital solutions. And the key to this is our mission: Make digital business automation easy.

We think that Low Code / No Code platforms are important here and must seamless work together with workflow automation and application development and integration on a central platform. Our goal is to give your employees digital superpower in their fields of expertise. The platform brings these experts closer together, so that they can make the best possible contribution to the digital goals of your company.

PIPEFORCE helps enterprises to achieve **digital superpower** by clearly separating the swimlanes of expertise but defining clear interfaces between the different roles so that they can work together very effectively to reach the same goals:
